        <div class="aboutMeText">
            <p>I am a dedicated worker that loves to learn new things and take on new challenges. <br>
                I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp to help me broaden <br>
                my skills and knowledge. I have a big focus on family and enjoy spending time with <br>
                them hiking, biking and camping but also appreciate a night in watching movies or <br>
                playing video games with my son.</p>
