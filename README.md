1. I think I did the best with writing the HTML portion. It was the least confusing and the easiest for me to research answers on. 
2. I believe this assignment was just about getting a basic structure put to gether. My solution was to use what we learned about HTML and CSS to build it. 
3. My process started with asking Standy for assistance at the end of Tuesday. After we ran out of time, I watched parts of the recorded Tuesday class. From there I had a better understanding of what to google and I looked up multiple YouTube Videos to walk me through the motions.
4. My challenges were... all of it! None of this was easy. I'm still mostly confused with git and GitHub.
5. I used the TC's, the links posted in slack, google, YouTube, the recorded classes and the slides.
